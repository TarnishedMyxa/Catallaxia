# Catallaxia ABM
Catallaxia is an agent-based model for simulating economic systems. It enables dynamic interactions between agents, allowing for the study of emergent behaviors and decentralized decision-making. Highly customizable and scalable, itâ€™s suitable for exploring various economic scenarios and research applications.

Extensibility and Customization
The core design of Catallaxia is built with flexibility in mind, enabling users to easily create their own models for agents, such as firms, consumers, and other economic entities. These custom agent models can be added seamlessly to the core framework, allowing for the simulation of diverse economic behaviors and scenarios.

Users can define their own agent rules, decision-making processes, and interactions, making it a powerful tool for tailored simulations that reflect specific research needs or theoretical explorations.

Key Features:
Custom Agent Models: Easily build and integrate models for various economic agents (firms, consumers, etc.).
Modular Design: Add your custom agents to the core framework without affecting other components.
Flexible Simulation: Customize agent behavior and interactions to match specific economic contexts.
Catallaxia is designed to grow with your research, providing a platform where new agent types and behaviors can continuously evolve.
